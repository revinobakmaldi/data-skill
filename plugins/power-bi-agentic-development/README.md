### What is agentic development?

- *Agentic development* is when you use agents to help you build, manage, and optimize artifacts and software. This includes semantic models, reports, and the things around them, like workspaces, deployment pipelines, and also processes.
- A *marketplace* hosts *plugins* that you can install. Plugins are a collection of resources that help coding agents perform better. They are typically special instruction files and scripts. Plugins can contain skills, subagents, hooks, and MCP servers focused on special topics or tasks.
- This marketplace is focused on everything to help your agent work well with Power BI and Fabric! Read further for more information.

## Installation

Here's how you get started in Claude Code; run this in the terminal to get the marketplace: 

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development
```

### Example: Using the pbir-cli with the skills

[Click here for a YouTube walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acHDorTi62U)

[![pbir-cli demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/acHDorTi62U/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acHDorTi62U)

### Claude Code

Add the marketplace, then install plugins via `/plugin` and navigating to the installed marketplace.

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="media/marketplace-ui.png" alt="Marketplace UI" width="400"></td>
<td align="center"><img src="media/marketplace-auto-update.png" alt="Marketplace auto-update" width="400"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><em>Install plugins from the marketplace</em></td>
<td align="center"><em>Enable marketplace auto-update</em></td>
</tr>
</table>

Alternative; add plugins via command line:

```bash
claude plugin install tabular-editor@power-bi-agentic-development
claude plugin install pbi-desktop@power-bi-agentic-development
claude plugin install semantic-models@power-bi-agentic-development
claude plugin install reports@power-bi-agentic-development
claude plugin install pbip@power-bi-agentic-development
claude plugin install fabric-cli@power-bi-agentic-development
```

### Copilot CLI

The standalone [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli) supports plugin installation from GitHub repos. Copilot CLI reads the same `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` manifest this repo uses, so the marketplace and child-plugin layout works without modification.

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows long paths</strong></summary>

TMDL files have a problem with repository-relative paths over 260 characters. Windows' legacy MAX_PATH blocks `git clone` from writing them unless long path support is enabled at both the OS and git level. Without this, `copilot plugin install` aborts with `Filename too long`.

Check [`useful-stuff/agent-scripts/enable-windows-longpaths.ps1`](useful-stuff/agent-scripts/enable-windows-longpaths.ps1) as an example of a script you can run from an elevated ps environment to enable long paths; there are other routes to do this that you can find online, too... just ask Copilot. A reboot is recommended after the registry change. This is a Windows OS limitation, documented at [Maximum Path Length Limitation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation).

See also the below `git config` command:

```powershell
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Additional installation instructions</strong></summary>

This repository is an [Anthropic-format plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) (a set of plugins), not a single distributable plugin, so the root `.claude-plugin/` contains only `marketplace.json`. Two documented install paths work:

**1. Register the marketplace once, then install named child plugins. Example:**

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development
copilot plugin install tabular-editor@power-bi-agentic-development
```

**2. Or install a single plugin directly from its subdirectory, no marketplace registration needed. Example:**

```bash
copilot plugin install data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development:plugins/pbip
```

Both forms are documented in the [Copilot CLI plugin reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-plugin-reference) and the [plugins how-to](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-finding-installing). Inside an interactive Copilot session, `/plugin install PLUGIN-NAME@MARKETPLACE-NAME` is the equivalent of (1). The bare `copilot plugin install data-goblin/power-bi-agentic-development` (no qualifier) will not install anything useful, because the root is a marketplace catalog, not a plugin.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Verify installation in Copilot CLI</strong></summary>

Inside Copilot CLI:

```
/env                    # Loaded instructions, MCP servers, skills, agents, plugins, LSPs, extensions
/plugin list            # Installed plugins
/skills list            # Available skills
/skills info pbip       # Details for a specific skill
/agent                  # Browse installed agents
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Compatibility notes</strong></summary>

- **Skills** load identically; Copilot CLI reads `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- **Agents** use the `*.agent.md` extension required by Copilot CLI's documented convention. Claude Code matches any `*.md` file in `agents/`, so the dual extension works in both tools.
- **MCP servers** load from `.mcp.json` (plugin root) or `.github/mcp.json`. The plugins in this repo do not currently ship MCP servers.
- **Hooks** are registered via `hooks.json` and reference scripts using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. Copilot CLI **≥ 1.0.26** (2026-04-14) sets `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` for plugin hooks ([changelog](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/blob/main/changelog.md)); older builds do not, which causes hook commands to resolve to broken paths. Run `copilot update` if hooks fail to fire. Native Windows bash users may also hit a separate path-format bug tracked upstream at [claude-code#11984](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/11984).

## Overview

The repo contains skills, agents, and hooks.

- **Skills** teach agents domain knowledge and workflows. They activate automatically based on task context, or can be invoked manually with `/skill-name`. In Claude Code, skills and commands have coalesced; commands are simply more prescriptive skill workflows.
- **Agents** are autonomous subprocesses that handle complex, multi-step tasks independently; typically used for review and validation.
- **Hooks** run automatically after tool use to validate files and catch errors early. They are deterministic; they fire when a specific pattern is matched, not by LLM judgment.

Hook checks can be individually toggled via config files. Set any check to `false` to disable it:
- `plugins/pbip/hooks/config.yaml` -- PBIR, TMDL, and report binding validation
- `plugins/pbi-desktop/hooks/config.yaml` -- DAX references, measure metadata, referential integrity, metadata cache

## Useful stuff

General-purpose agent resources that don't fit into a plugin: defensive hooks, patterns, and tools. See [`useful-stuff/`](useful-stuff/).

## Use or re-use of these skills

These plugins are intended for free community use.

You do not have the license to copy and incorporate them into your own products, trainings, courses, or tools. If you copy these skills - manually or by using an agent to rewrite them - you must include attribution and a link to this original project. That includes you, Microsoft.
